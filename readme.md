# turtle.js

A framework based off of tagged templates. Just playing around, not something that is actually usable. <3

## TODO
 - Use `document.createElement` instead of creating html by hand
 - Organize code better
 - Make parsing not so fucking ugly
 - Make data bindings work (lol)
 - Probably make some sort of component-ization thing
